## PUBLIC HEALTH INVOLVEMENT

Other than the computer science track, I am primarily and foremost a Public Health major. I believe both are extremely important in todayâ€™s world to make a change. Therefore, I am also involved in Pre-Health clubs such as the Pre-Medical Association (PMA) at UH Manoa. I have been an active member of PMA for two years, and in my first year, I was on the Multimedia & Publications Committee. In a sense, my project was yearlong. 




## DUTIES IN PMA

The duties of being on the Multimedia & Publications Committee is to handle its social media pages, take pictures of the events, create videos for the PMA banquets, attend and offer ideas at meetings, and assist the Multimedia & Publications Chair on whatever it is. This required me to go to as many events as I could so that I could take pictures. The committee had other members help take pictures of events that we could not go to by implementing a system to give them points for taking meaningful photos. Videos and photos were all collected at the end, and I put together a video of the memories of our PMA members for the banquet. The responsibility was actually given to me extremely last minute, and I really only had a few hours beforehand to complete it. Luckily, I managed to finish it on time, and everyone enjoyed it!



## WHAT I GAINED FROM PMA

I was able to expose myself to a plethora of professionals, careers, workshops, services in PMA. I also learned material that was outside the scope of public health. The best part of it is connecting to so many other students like me who support one another and push each other to grow. I would not have applied to be a part of the committee if I was not given the encouragement to do it. I was able to learn and practice leadership, cooperation, and time management during stressful times.
