## INTRODUCTION OF JAVASCRIPT

I must admit, based on what I have learned about Javascript, it does seem more interesting than other languages I learned so far in my computer science track. Although I have heard that Javascript is better than Java and C++, it has been challenging to understand. For instance, it uses “const” and “let” rather than “var” when introducing a new variable. Arrays in Javascript are also not confined to one data type; rather, it can hold an integer and string in one! I’m not used to this type of practicality, but it seems extremely helpful for the coder. My first time working with Javascript was through FreeCodeCamp, so I am freshly immersed in this language and still have a lot to learn and practice! I think once I am comfortable with using Javascript, I might like it more than any other programming language.



## WORKING OUT EVERY DAY

When I say, “working out,” I mean working out the brain. Exercising intensely for one day can build muscles but it will not maintain it. Like working out the body, learning a coding language cannot be done in one sitting. It definitely takes practice every day for a couple of hours to retain the information and skills that we learn. Luckily, the athletic software engineering approach using the practice WODs (“Workout of the Day”) from my Software Engineering course is helping me to strengthen my coding and exercise my problem-solving skills. It is stressful, but I believe, through this training, I’ll be a strong coder by the end of it.



## HOPES

I feel motivated to improve my coding skills. It will take a lot of hard work, effort, and time to get to where I want to be, but the best thing about this field is that there is no stagnation. It is continually evolving, and we all continually learn. Starting Javascript is just the beginning for me.
