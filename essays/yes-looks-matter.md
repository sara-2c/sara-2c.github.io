I’ve always had a penchant for pretty things. I read books based on their covers, wear intricate clothing that isn’t always practical, buy household items for their cute designs rather than their functionality. It’s not the best habit to have, but I know that I’m not the only one who does this. Teens nowadays go to boba shops because they have nice interior designs or well-established Instagram pages, not for the quality of the drink. Most industries use beautiful models to sell their products (like the one to the left). It’s the same when internet users wander onto a poorly developed website and instantly closes the window. Looks matter in this society, unfortunately.

## WHY SHOULD WE USE UI FRAMEWORKS?
Growing up, I learned that presentation is key. Presentation may be as important, and dare I say, even more important than the contents of the matter sometimes. As internet usage becomes more common, web developers need to keep up with this. Thus, UI Frameworks were created for this reason. 

Based on my experience with Semantic UI (the only UI Framework I have worked with), I learned how easy it can be to flesh out an attractive page. I also learned that I never want to design a website without a UI Framework. Sure, I could use only HTML and CSS to build a website from scratch, but I can’t imagine the painful hours of trying to position, reposition, and implement interactive elements when I could make the same thing faster with Semantic UI. I was able to turn my amateur website look like something that I was proud to look at. 

## CONS?	
However, these frameworks can get complicated. There are many different frameworks, so like programming languages, we have to learn them. However, also similar to programming languages, learning one makes it easier to learn the others. Frameworks may be limiting. Developers can only do as much as the framework allows, but it’s usually never to the point that it prevents them from executing their general ideas onto the page. I’m not one to be biased, but overall, UI Frameworks are worth it in creating and designing an appealing webpage. 

## YOU CAN DO IT, TOO
Even those who are not professional web designers can learn it. Some UI Frameworks use natural language, such as Semantic UI. It is easy to use, read, and edit when the code is written in the same form that a normal civilian is used to. If it’s not loud and clear enough already, UI Frameworks is the secret weapon to web design and customization! Don’t think it’s unnecessary because looks matter.
